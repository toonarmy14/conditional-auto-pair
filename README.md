<!-- Plugin description -->
Enable additional options for controlling when "matching" brackets* are automatically inserted in the editor. 

This plugin adds the ability to disable the automatic-insertion of a matching bracket/quotation mark when your cursor is immediatly succeeded by text. Stated another way, *only* insert a matching bracket when the cursor immediately precedes whitespace or is at the end of the line. 

This will be useful if you are like me and don't bother to highlight/select a word you now want to quote or surround with braces and constantly have to delete–a two-handed endeavor on mac–the auto-inserted brace before proceeding. And I'll take all reductions in irritation I can get, no matter how trivial... :)

\* Except where obvious, I will use the term "brackets" generally to include _all_ **"paired delimeters"** `[],(),{},<>,',"`; the four main "bracket family" members as well as single- and double-quotation marks `' "`. \
\
If necessary to refer to one of them individually, I'll do so as follows:\
|symbol|name|
|:-:|:--|
|`[]`|square brackets|
|`()`|parentheses|
|`{}`|braces|
|`<>`|angle brackets|
